# Distributed Ledger Definition

A ***distributed ledger*** (also known as ***distributed ledger technology***, DLT) is a digital system for recording events across multiple locations.
In contrast to traditional databases based on some centralized solution, a distributed ledger is shared and synchronized by participants interested in data stored by the ledger.

The most known example of DLT is a blockchain.

# Key characteristics of a Distributed Ledger

- *Decentralization*. Nobody can control a ledger without cooperation with interested entities (further, referred to as ***participants***).
- *Distribution*. ***Replicies*** (or copies) of the ledger are stored in the individual isolated memory of each participant.
- *Immutability*. After any data unit has been recorded, it cannot be edited or removed.
- *Transparency*. All participants have access to view the ledger's contents.
- *Security*. The integrity of stored data is protected with cryptography methods.
